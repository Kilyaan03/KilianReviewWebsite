# KilianReviewWebsite
My website where I post reviews on subjects. I didn't bother adding comments where it would become too repetitive.

How to run:

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.  (Most modern browsers can open HTML files directly.)

*OR*

2. If that doesn't work, install the Live Server extension (by Ritwick Dey) in your IDE (like VS Code), and then right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server".
