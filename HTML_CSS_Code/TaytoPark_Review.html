                <p>It was officially opened in 2010.</p>

                <h2>Best Rides</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Tayto Park, now known as Emerald Park, is a fantastic theme park, and while I enjoy all the attractions, some rides definitely stand out as my favourites. Here's a quick review of a couple of them:</p>

    <p><b>The Cú Chulainn Coaster:</b> This is an absolute must-ride! As Europe's first wooden roller coaster with an inversion, it's a unique and thrilling experience. The combination of the classic wooden coaster feel with the modern twist of an inversion is just brilliant.  The speed and the airtime you get are incredible.  Definitely a highlight of any visit!</p>

    <p><b>The Viking Voyage:</b>  Who doesn't love a good splash? The Viking Voyage is a log flume that delivers on the thrills and the spills.  The anticipation as you climb the big hill is intense, and the drop is so much fun!  You're guaranteed to get soaked, which is perfect on a warm day.  Plus, the theming around the ride adds to the experience.</p>

    <p><b>The Rotator:</b> If you like spinning rides, the Rotator is a good choice.  It's fast and disorienting in the best way possible.  It's a classic fairground-style ride, but it's always a good laugh.  Definitely not one for those with weak stomachs, though!</p>

    <p>Overall, Emerald Park (Tayto Park) offers a great selection of rides, but these are the ones I always make sure to go on.  Whether you're a thrill-seeker or prefer something a bit more relaxed, there's something for everyone to enjoy.</p>
